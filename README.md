## LearningWithGitHub
Created an application to help users find relevant github repository to learn from based on the github user's number of stars and forks. I decided to create this application because github was something new to me then but I was not sure which repository would be good to learn from. As such, I created this application to help users navigate more easily with a user friendly UI with React.

Users can alternate  between light and dark themes and to help decide which repository, a gamification layout is used to help users decide which github repository is more credible

Have fun exploring and learning with Github using this user-friendly application!
